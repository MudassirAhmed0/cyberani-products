              The scope of threats in the digital landscape is evolving. In
              2022, 110 million cyber threats were detected in KSA, with
              breaches in this region costing 1.7 times the global average. From
              intelligent phishing to industrial-scale shadow AI, enterprises
              are faced with the strategic task of fortifying their digital
              assets and infrastructures.Â
